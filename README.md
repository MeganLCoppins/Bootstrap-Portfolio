# Bootstrap-Portfolio
 
 ## Description

I built my Bootstrap Portfolio using Bootstrap CSS Framework to create a responsive design that ensures compatability on a variety of devices and screen sizes. 

I created 3 pages: 

* index.html
* portfolio.html 
* contact.html 

I used Bootstrap's grid system to create a responsive layout, using sub-rows and sub-columns in the portfolio.html. 

For each page I added a navbar and sticky footer. For both index.html and portfolio.html I added responsive images and for the contact.html I added 3 forms. 

## Demonstration 

The following images demonstrate the About Me, Portfolio, and Contact Pages:
